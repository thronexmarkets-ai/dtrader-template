## Phase 1: Critical (Week 1) - Quick Wins 🔥

**Goal:** Reduce initial bundle by 50% (13.8 MiB → 7 MiB)

### 1.1 Split Vendor Bundles ⚠️

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
**Estimated Impact:** Minimal (conservative approach to maintain stability)
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETED (Conservative approach taken)

**Note:** Original aggressive splitting broke the app due to externals pattern in trader/reports packages. Implemented minimal, safe changes only.

- [x] **Update webpack config for core package**
    - [x] Open `packages/core/build/webpack.config.js`
    - [x] Add `charts` cache group for @deriv-com/smartcharts-champion (priority: 20)
    - [x] Keep existing `defaultVendors` cache group intact
    - [x] Did NOT split framework/icons/ui (breaks externals pattern)
    - [x] Save file: `packages/core/build/webpack.config.js:58-64`

- [x] **Remove duplicate chart assets**
    - [x] Open `packages/core/build/config.js`
    - [x] Remove duplicate copies to `contract/assets` and `bot/assets`
    - [x] Keep single copy in `assets/`
    - [x] Saves 3.2 MB (1.59 MB NOTICES file × 2)
    - [x] Save file: `packages/core/build/config.js:15-17`

- [ ] **Update webpack config for trader package**
    - [ ] NOT DONE - Trader uses externals pattern, cannot safely split vendors
    - [ ] Would break module resolution if changed

- [ ] **Update webpack config for reports package**
    - [ ] NOT DONE - Reports uses externals pattern, cannot safely split vendors
    - [ ] Would break module resolution if changed

- [x] **Test the changes**
    - [x] Run `npm run build --workspace=@deriv/core`
    - [x] Verify app builds successfully
    - [x] Verify bundle size reduced by ~3.2 MB (duplicate assets removed)
    - [x] Charts library isolated for better caching
    - [x] No breaking changes to module resolution

- [x] **Test functionality**
    - [x] Verify app loads correctly
    - [x] Test trading form functionality
    - [x] Test reports page
    - [x] Verify no console errors
    - [x] Verify no React primitive value errors

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ Charts cache group added (improves caching)
- ✅ Duplicate assets removed (saves 3.2 MB)
- ✅ All functionality works as before
- ✅ No breaking changes to externals pattern

**What Changed:**

- **Added:** Charts cache group in core webpack config
- **Removed:** Duplicate chart asset copies (bot/assets, contract/assets)
- **NOT Changed:** Trader/reports configs (externals pattern preserved)

### 1.2 Add observer() to ScreenLarge Component ✅

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Estimated Impact:** -60% re-renders
**Status:** COMPLETED

    - [x] Add import: `import { observer } from '@deriv/stores';`
    - [x] Wrap component: `const ScreenLarge = observer(({ ... }) => ( ... ));`
    - [x] Verify export: `export default ScreenLarge;`
    - [x] Save file

- [x] **Verify observer is imported**
    - [x] Check line 1-10 for import statement
    - [x] Ensure it's from `@deriv/stores` not `mobx-react-lite`

- [x] **Test the changes**
    - [x] Run `npm run test:jest -- screen-large.spec.tsx`
    - [x] Verify tests pass
    - [x] Run dev server: `npm run serve --workspace=@deriv/core`
    - [x] Open React DevTools Profiler

**Estimated Time:** 0 hours (Already implemented)
**Estimated Impact:** Defer 15.8 MiB, -3 seconds TTI
**Status:** ALREADY COMPLETED (No changes needed)

**Findings:** SmartCharts is already fully optimized with lazy loading in the codebase!

- [x] **Chart already lazy-loaded**
    - [x] File: `packages/trader/src/Modules/SmartChart/index.js:7-27`
    - [x] Uses `React.lazy()` for all chart components
    - [x] Dynamic import with webpack chunk name: `/* webpackChunkName: "smart_chart" */`
    - [x] Implementation:

        ```javascript
        const init = () => {
            module = moduleLoader(() => {
                return import(/* webpackChunkName: "smart_chart" */ '@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion');
            });
        };

        const load = component_name => () => {
            if (!module) init();
            return module.then(module => ({ default: module[component_name] }));
        };

        export const SmartChart = React.lazy(load('SmartChart'));
        ```

- [x] **All chart components lazy-loaded**
    - [x] SmartChart (main component)
    - [x] ChartTitle, ChartSize, ChartMode
    - [x] DrawTools, Share, StudyLegend, Views
    - [x] ToolbarWidget
    - [x] FastMarker, RawMarker

- [x] **Loading behavior verified**
    - [x] Chart NOT loaded on initial page load
    - [x] Only loads when chart component is rendered
    - [x] Suspense boundaries already in place in consuming components
    - [x] Chart loads on-demand when user navigates to Trade page

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ Chart loaded on demand (already implemented)
- ✅ Chart chunk ~15 MB separate (already split)

        const ContractDetails = lazy(
            () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "trader-contract-details" */ 'AppV2/Containers/ContractDetails')
        );
        ```
    - [x] Added AI markers for tracking
    - [x] Used descriptive webpack chunk names

- [x] **Suspense boundaries already in place**

    - [x] Uses UILoader as fallback component
    - [x] ErrorBoundary handled at app level

- [x] **Webpack chunk output verified**
    - [x] trader.trader-trade.js → 1.9 MB (main trading interface)
    - [x] trader.trader-contract-details.js → 260 KB (contract details page)
    - [x] trader.trader-positions.js → 153 KB (positions page)
    - [x] Total: 2.3 MB now loaded on-demand

- [x] **Test the changes**
    - [x] Run `npm run build --workspace=@deriv/trader` → ✅ success
    - [x] Run `npm run build --workspace=@deriv/core` → ✅ success

- ✅ Routing configuration maintained
- ✅ Total 2.3 MB deferred for users who don't visit all pages

**Performance Impact:**

- Users visiting only homepage: Save 413 KB (positions + contract-details not loaded)
- Users who never check positions: Save 153 KB permanently
- Better cache granularity: Trade changes don't invalidate Positions cache

          "typescript": "^5.0.0"
        }
        ```
    - [x] Enforces @deriv-com/analytics 1.31.3 (API package has 1.31.6 but minimal impact)

### 3.2 Debounce localStorage Writes

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours
**Estimated Impact:** Eliminate UI jank, -70% writes

- [ ] **Update BaseStore**
    - [ ] Open `packages/trader/src/Stores/base-store.ts`
    - [ ] Add lodash.debounce import: `import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';`
    - [ ] Create debounced persist method:
        ```typescript
        private debouncedPersist = debounce(() => {
          this.persistToStorage();
        }, 500); // 500ms debounce
        ```

- [ ] **Add reaction for persistence**
    - [ ] Import reaction: `import { reaction } from 'mobx';`
    - [ ] In constructor, add reaction:
        ```typescript
        reaction(
            () => this.getPersistedProperties(),
            () => this.debouncedPersist(),
            { delay: 100 }
        );
        ```

- [ ] **Reduce persisted properties**
    - [ ] Open `packages/trader/src/Stores/Modules/Trading/trade-store.ts`
    - [ ] Review `local_storage_properties` array
    - [ ] Remove transient properties:
        - [ ] Remove `amount` (should come from balance)
        - [ ] Remove `barrier_1` (depends on spot)
        - [ ] Remove `barrier_2`
        - [ ] Remove `expiry_date` (calculated)
    - [ ] Keep only user preferences:
        - [ ] Keep `contract_type`
        - [ ] Keep `duration_unit`
        - [ ] Keep `has_cancellation`
        - [ ] Keep `is_trade_params_expanded`

- [ ] **Test the changes**
    - [ ] Run dev server
    - [ ] Open Chrome DevTools → Application → Local Storage
    - [ ] Rapidly drag barrier
    - [ ] Verify localStorage updates at most once per 500ms
    - [ ] Verify no UI jank
    - [ ] Test barrier dragging is smooth (60fps)
    - [ ] Close and reopen browser
    - [ ] Verify user preferences persisted

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ localStorage writes debounced (500ms)
- ✅ UI jank eliminated
- ✅ Only preferences persisted
- ✅ User preferences restored on reload

### 3.3 Configure React Query Caching

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Estimated Impact:** -50% redundant API requests

- [ ] **Update QueryClient config**
    - [ ] Open `packages/api/src/APIProvider.tsx`
    - [ ] Locate QueryClient instantiation (around line 126)
    - [ ] Update defaultOptions:
        ```typescript
        const queryClient = new QueryClient({
            defaultOptions: {
                queries: {
                    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
                    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
                    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
                    refetchOnMount: false,
                    refetchOnReconnect: true,
                    retry: 2,
                    retryDelay: attemptIndex => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000),
                },
                mutations: {
                    retry: 1,
                },
            },
        });
        ```

- [ ] **Configure per-query caching**
    - [ ] Identify static queries that change rarely:
        - [ ] `active_symbols` → staleTime: 15 minutes
        - [ ] `trading_times` → staleTime: 1 hour
        - [ ] `website_status` → staleTime: 30 seconds
    - [ ] Update individual useQuery calls with specific staleTime

- [ ] **Test the changes**
    - [ ] Run dev server
    - [ ] Open Network tab
    - [ ] Load app
    - [ ] Count `active_symbols` requests → should be 1
    - [ ] Reload page
    - [ ] Verify cached data used (no new request)
    - [ ] Wait 5 minutes, interact
    - [ ] Verify refetch occurs
    - [ ] Test with multiple tabs
    - [ ] Verify data shared across tabs

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ Query caching configured
- ✅ Redundant requests reduced by 50%
- ✅ Data stays fresh (refetch after staleTime)
- ✅ No stale data issues

## Phase 4: Low Priority (Backlog) - Polish ✨

**Goal:** Eliminate remaining inefficiencies

### 4.1 Add Subscription Cleanup Registry

**Priority:** LOW
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours
**Estimated Impact:** Prevent memory leaks

- [ ] **Create subscription registry**
    - [ ] Open `packages/api/src/useSubscription.ts`
    - [ ] Add Map for tracking:
        ```typescript
        const subscriptionRegistry = new Map<
            string,
            {
                subscription: any;
                lastAccessed: number;
                refCount: number;
            }
        >();
        ```

- [ ] **Add cleanup interval**
    - [ ] Add setInterval for stale cleanup:
        ```typescript
        setInterval(
            () => {
                const now = Date.now();
                for (const [id, { subscription, lastAccessed }] of subscriptionRegistry) {
                    if (now - lastAccessed > 5 * 60 * 1000) {
                        subscription.unsubscribe();
                        subscriptionRegistry.delete(id);
                    }
                }
            },
            5 * 60 * 1000
        ); // Every 5 minutes
        ```

- [ ] **Update subscribe/unsubscribe**
    - [ ] Track subscriptions in registry
    - [ ] Implement reference counting
    - [ ] Update lastAccessed on data

- [ ] **Test memory leaks**
    - [ ] Open Chrome DevTools → Memory
    - [ ] Take heap snapshot
    - [ ] Use app for 1 hour
    - [ ] Take another heap snapshot
    - [ ] Compare snapshots
    - [ ] Verify no subscription leaks
    - [ ] Verify registry cleanup works

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ Subscription registry implemented
- ✅ Stale subscriptions cleaned up
- ✅ No memory leaks after 2-hour session
- ✅ Heap size stable

### 4.2 Tree-Shake Icon Imports ✅

**Priority:** LOW
**Estimated Time:** 0 hours (Already optimized)
**Estimated Impact:** No impact (already tree-shakeable)
**Status:** ALREADY COMPLETED (No changes needed)

**Findings:** Icon imports are already optimally configured for tree-shaking!

- [x] **Audit icon imports**
    - [x] Searched codebase: `grep -r "from '@deriv/quill-icons'" packages/`
    - [x] Found 20+ files importing icons from @deriv/quill-icons
    - [x] All imports use named import pattern: `import { LegacyHomeNewIcon } from '@deriv/quill-icons'`
    - [x] No wildcard imports found (`import * as Icons`)

- [x] **Icon package already configured for tree-shaking**
    - [x] File: `node_modules/@deriv/quill-icons/package.json`
    - [x] Has `"sideEffects": false` ✅ - Enables webpack tree-shaking
    - [x] Has proper `exports` configuration with ESM/CJS entry points
    - [x] Separate exports for each icon category:
        - `./Legacy` → Legacy icons
        - `./LabelPaired` → Label paired icons
        - `./Standalone` → Standalone icons
        - `./Currencies`, `./Flags`, `./Logo`, etc.
    - [x] Both ESM and CJS formats available for optimal bundling

- [x] **All imports already use optimal pattern**
    - [x] ✅ Named imports: `import { LegacyHomeNewIcon } from '@deriv/quill-icons'`
    - [x] ✅ Specific category imports also supported
    - [x] Examples from codebase:

        ```typescript
        // packages/core/src/App/Containers/Layout/header/brand-short-logo.tsx:6
        import { BrandDerivLogoCoralIcon } from '@deriv/quill-icons';

        // packages/core/src/Components/markers/marker-line.jsx:5
        import { LegacyExitTimeIcon, LegacyStartTimeIcon, LegacyResetIcon } from '@deriv/quill-icons';
        ```

- [x] **Webpack tree-shaking already configured**
    - [x] Production mode enabled ✅
    - [x] Webpack automatically tree-shakes based on `sideEffects: false`
    - [x] Only imported icons included in bundle

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ All icon imports use named imports (not wildcard)
- ✅ @deriv/quill-icons has `sideEffects: false` configured
- ✅ Webpack tree-shaking enabled in production mode
- ✅ Only used icons included in bundle
- ✅ No wildcard imports that would prevent tree-shaking

**No Changes Required** - Icon imports are already optimally configured for tree-shaking!

### 4.3 Optimize CSS Bundle

**Priority:** LOW
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours
**Estimated Impact:** -200 KB to -500 KB CSS size (realistic target)
**Status:** ANALYZED (Optimization opportunities identified)

**Current CSS Bundle Analysis:**

- [x] **Bundle size breakdown**
    - [x] **Core Package CSS:**
        - core.main.css: 525 KB (23,277 lines)
        - core.chunk.vendors (quill-ui): 1.1 MB (18,105 lines) ⚠️ LARGEST
        - core.chunk.charts.css: 163 KB (8,120 lines)
        - core.chunk.dtrader-header.css: 33 KB (1,613 lines)
        - core.chunk.url-unavailable-modal.css: 3.6 KB (138 lines)
        - **Total Core CSS: ~1.8 MB**

    - [x] **Trader Package CSS:**
        - trader.main.css: 1.16 MB (bundle analyzer warning)
        - **Total Trader CSS: 1.16 MB**

    - [x] **Grand Total: ~2.96 MB of CSS** across all packages

**Key Finding - Quill-UI CSS (1.1 MB):**

- [x] File: `node_modules/@deriv-com/quill-ui/dist/assets/base2.css` (885 KB minified)
- [x] Contains:
    - Google Font imports (Ubuntu, IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Mono) via @import
    - Complete design system CSS variables (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
    - Base styles for all quill-ui components
    - Cannot be split further (monolithic design system CSS)
- [x] **Issue**: Imported whenever ANY quill-ui component is used
- [x] AppV2 (mobile) uses 20+ quill-ui components → entire CSS loaded

**Optimization Opportunities Identified:**

- [x] **1. Font Loading Optimization** ✅ (COMPLETED - Reduces render-blocking)
    - [x] Added `preconnect` for Google Fonts API (packages/core/src/index.html:154-157)
    - [x] Added `preload` hints for font stylesheets (lines 159-174)
    - [x] Implemented async font loading using media="print" trick (lines 176-194)
    - [x] Fonts now load asynchronously instead of blocking render
    - [x] Implementation:

        ```html
        <!-- packages/core/src/index.html:153-195 -->
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />

        <!-- Preload critical fonts -->
        <link rel="preload" as="style" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Ubuntu:wght@700&display=swap" />
        <link rel="preload" as="style" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Sans..." />

        <!-- Load fonts asynchronously -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="..." media="print" onload="this.media='all'" />
        ```

    - [x] Benefits: Eliminates render-blocking @import, parallel font loading, better FCP
    - ⚠️ Note: @import still exists in quill-ui CSS but HTML loads override for better performance

- [ ] **2. PurgeCSS Integration** (Estimated: -100 KB to -300 KB)
    - [ ] Install: `npm install --save-dev @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss`
    - [ ] Configure postcss.config.js in packages/core/build/
    - [ ] Important considerations:
        - Must safelist dynamic classes (MobX, chart classes, modal classes)
        - Test thoroughly to avoid removing needed styles
        - May break quill-ui styles if too aggressive
    - [ ] Safelist patterns needed:
        ```javascript
        safelist: {
          standard: [/^dc-/, /^cq-/, /^mobx-/, /^active/, /^disabled/, /^error/],
          deep: [/modal/, /tooltip/, /dropdown/],
          greedy: [/data-/]
        }
        ```

- [x] **3. CSS Splitting by Route** ✅ (COMPLETED - Defers CSS until needed)
    - [x] Updated trader webpack config (packages/trader/build/webpack.config.js:21-49)
    - [x] Added splitChunks configuration for CSS code splitting
    - [x] CSS now splits automatically per lazy-loaded route
    - [x] Implementation:
        ```javascript
        optimization: {
          splitChunks: {
            chunks: 'all',
            cacheGroups: {
              styles: {
                name: false,
                test: /\.s?css$/,
                chunks: 'all',
                enforce: true,
                priority: 20,
              },
              vendorStyles: {
                name: 'vendors',
                test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/].*\.s?css$/,
                chunks: 'all',
                enforce: true,
                priority: 30,
              },
            },
          },
        }
        ```
    - [x] Result: CSS bundle split into 12+ chunks instead of 1 monolithic file:
        - trader.vendors.css: 1.2 MB (quill-ui + node_modules)
        - trader.styles-\*.css: Multiple smaller chunks (2-161 KB each)
        - Total: Same size, but loaded on-demand per route
    - [x] Benefits: Users who don't visit all pages save bandwidth
    - ⚠️ Note: Webpack warnings about CSS order conflicts are expected and non-critical

- [ ] **4. Audit for Duplicate Styles** (Estimated: -50 KB to -150 KB)
    - [ ] Compare core.main.css vs trader.main.css for duplicates
    - [ ] Check for duplicate utility classes across packages
    - [ ] Consolidate shared styles into @deriv/components
    - [ ] Tools to use:
        - `csso` for CSS optimization
        - `cssnano` for minification
        - Manual review of class name patterns

- [ ] **5. Remove Unused SCSS Files** (Estimated: -20 KB to -50 KB)
    - [ ] Search for deprecated/unused SCSS imports
    - [ ] Use `coverage` tools to identify unused styles
    - [ ] Remove legacy styles from older UI versions

**Test plan:**

- [ ] **Visual regression testing**
    - [ ] Test all pages: Trade, Positions, Reports, Contract Details
    - [ ] Test all themes: Light, Dark
    - [ ] Test all breakpoints: Mobile, Tablet, Desktop
    - [ ] Test all states: Active, Disabled, Error, Loading
    - [ ] Test dynamic classes (modals, dropdowns, tooltips)

- [ ] **Performance testing**
    - [ ] Measure CSS bundle size before/after
    - [ ] Verify FCP improvement (CSS is render-blocking)
    - [ ] Check Network waterfall for font loading
    - [ ] Verify no FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ CSS bundle reduced by 200-500 KB (realistic, given 1.1 MB is quill-ui base)
- ✅ No visual regressions in any theme/breakpoint
- ✅ Fonts load optimally (no render-blocking @import)
- ✅ Route-based CSS splitting implemented
- ✅ PurgeCSS configured with proper safelists
- ✅ All functionality works correctly

**Realistic Expectations:**

- Quill-UI CSS (1.1 MB) is largely unavoidable unless we:
    1. Fork quill-ui and tree-shake CSS (major effort)
    2. Switch to a different UI library (not feasible)
    3. Request upstream changes from @deriv-com/quill-ui maintainers
- Target reduction: 200-500 KB (7-17% improvement)
- Main wins: Font loading, PurgeCSS, route splitting
